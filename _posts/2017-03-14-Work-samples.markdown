Writing: [This is a little pamphlet](/assets/backissues1.pdf) of writing and photography samples I put together with InDesign. The photos are mine, the movie poster and DM art are not.  

Layout: [Here is a draft cover and layout template](/assets/URJiit_draft_template.pdf) for URJiit, the Undergraduate Research Journal of Illinois Institute of Technology, which I co-founded.  

Full publications: URJiit's first official issue of research abstracts can be found at the [journal's site][URJiit abstracts].  
I also did layout work for TechNews, Illinois Tech's student newspaper; [here is an issue][TechNews] I had a hand in making clear and consistent.
