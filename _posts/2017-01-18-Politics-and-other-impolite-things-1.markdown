>“The Trump administration”  

I wonder if/when I will get used to that phrase. I have tried putting a tolerable spin on this, 
but nothing sticks. From suggesting outright [murder][kill-families] to flatly saying that his campaign statements
and themes [were lies][truth-trump], nothing more than entertainment for the crowds to eat up... 
there is no “good way” to look at this. I don’t even have the comfort of ignorance I had when George W. Bush took office.  

At the time, I favored Bush over Gore because Bush was, for me, a complete unknown. Meanwhile, Gore, his wife, 
and his would-be VP had all worked to censor/ban music, movies, and games. An unknown vs outright enemies of 
free expression and entertainment. For me, it was a simple choice. Just to give you a hint of how ridiculous 
this effort became, the singer of Twisted Sister [appeared before the senate][snyder-has-the-floor] to address 
nigh-deliberate misinterpretation and outright lies spread against his band, and a Frank Zappa album was tagged 
in stores as having objectionable “explicit lyrics”... the album [was an instrumental][zapped].  

In my defense, I didn’t learn of the “[Project for the New American Century][loc]” (AKA: the Bush administration’s 
openly-secret manifesto, drafted and signed before the election and [subsequent][Iraq-before-9-11] wars that 
[Cheney & Co.][dubya-admin] sought) until Bush’s second term, far too late for it to matter.  

Then, Obama got elected and the GOP’s slide into insanity, which as far as I can tell began during Bill Clinton’s 
second term, became an outright plummet. Since then, the political right has lost its collective mind. Just in 
case the reader thinks I am merely spewing partisan hyperbole, I’ve made a list. Don’t worry, it’s not 
too long; I can only handle so many bad memories in one sitting.  

Looking like a [sulking teenager][what-bill] while in session, purging their own loyal members for being 
[inadequately hateful][purity-test] towards the president, [booing veterans][rainbow-6] for being gay and 
wanting (gasp!) rights, a member of the House science committee saying that evolution (AKA: the foundation of 
modern biology and medicine) “[is lies straight from the pit of Hell][what-the-hell]”, 
and making up [lies on record][not-intended] and then editing the record to pretend said lies never happened.  

Unfortunately, while the GOP has become increasingly unreasonable, the left has not improved itself. Instead, it seems 
to be puffing its ego at being the least unreasonable option, out of two, which is a sad state no matter how one looks at it.

To be continued in part two.
