I noticed that it has been a while since I made good on the whole “force myself to write” shtick. 
So, how about an obvious question: why the lack of science writing from the science journalism major?  
  
Well, professional discouragement definitely played a roll. 'Tis difficult to have a portfolio of science writing work 
if you are never hired, and recreational writing has felt like adding raindrops to the oceans of unpaid blog content.  

Put simply, I did not go to college for an art degree, to churn out content until someone feels inspired to pay me; 
I went to learn skills and methods for completing assigned tasks for a relevant company that needed such tasks completed. 
AKA: getting assignments or an area to cover, researching and investigating topics, analyzing/sifting masses of raw data, 
interviewing sources, writing articles, editing content/layout, repeat. Classical journalism.  

That idea has clearly not gone to plan. First, the Internet ravaged journalism. Then, the Great Recession killed most 
remaining job opportunities. Finally, the nation elected a black Democrat (twice) and half of the government lost its 
collective [insert preferred modifier] mind. Any one of those things would be discouraging. All three, combined with applications being met 
with silence that I could not learn from, made it almost impossible to maintain an optimistic perspective.  

Now, we have officials tasked with official science policy talking about a [chronic liar][is truth dead] being the only 
[source of truth][trump is the way truth and light] while refusing to accept that 
[changing the chemistry of the sky][never enough evidence] might affect the planet somehow. I could go on for 
paragraphs about how sickening and hopeless political news has been this past decade, but such a litany of disagreeable 
crap would not help my mood.  

So, missed opportunities, lack of known options, a government that is either idiotic or evil (the former sadly seems the 
most likely), and a populace that appears more concerned with ideological purity than objective reality. Spelling it all 
out offers a clearer view of how a would-be science journalist lost faith in both science and journalism, at least as far 
as the two making for a possible, even fruitful, career. I still find science and journalism to be where my mind feels 
most comfortable and where it might do the most good, or at least be most productive. But, such feelings ring as hollow 
as a parroted sales pitch when I seem to be shouting into a void and am not permitted to be of use.  

I came across an unattributed quote: "Don't cling to a mistake just because you spent a lot of time making it." I like it 
and hope to put it into action, but that brings up a question that has looped in my mind for years without an answer that 
has worked or that I have any confidence in: Go where and do what?
